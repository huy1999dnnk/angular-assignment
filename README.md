For this project, the hardest part was handling the authentication. The first time I installed the project, I accidentally enabled SSR. As a result, when I tried to store the token in localStorage, the app couldnâ€™t read the value (it said localStorage was undefined). I had to remove the project and reinstall it with SSR turned off.

When dealing with tokens, I also had to implement logic to obtain a new access token using a refresh token when the old one expired.

Another challenge was writing tests. Honestly, testing is not my strength, so I had to rely on AI to help me a bit. Additionally, setting up NGXS took a lot of time due to the amount of boilerplate code required.
